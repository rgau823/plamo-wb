            My name is Rocky and I am a plamo enthusiast. I enjoy building plastic models as a hobby. I built this site to demonstrate HTML and CSS.

          <summary>When did you start building?</summary>
          <p class="main__about-details">
            My earliest memory is actually a 1/100 No Grade Wing Zero Custom from when I was 6 years old, but I would say I really started building plamo when I was about 14 years old (2008). I stopped building when I entered university, but recently rediscovered my enjoyment in 2022.

          <summary>What do you like to build?</summary>
          <p class="main__about-details">
            I primarily started with Gundam model kits (which is probably the most common form). The world of plamo is quite expansive though and I am always interested in building other things. I have expanded my interests to other mecha series and manufacturers and also build some mecha musumes as well.
