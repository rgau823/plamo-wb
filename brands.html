      <p class="main__p">
        There are various plamo brands to produce kits. You can find a scale model of almost anything! Here are a few of the manufacturer's that I am most familiar with.
      </p>
      <h3>Bandai</h3>
      <p class="main__p">
        Probably the most well-known manufacturer. Most well-known for their Gundam kits, Bandai is probably the best entry point for most of those interested in going into plamo. They have several ines geared towards entry-level builders including their Entry Grade, 30 Minute Missions, and more.
      </p>
      <h3>Kotobukiya</h3>
      <p class="main__p">
        The next largest manufacturer. Also from Japan, Kotobukiya produces all sorts of model kits. They primarily produce kits based on licensed properties, but also have their own original line under Frame Arms. They also are well-known for their Megami Device kits which are kits featuring stylized female characters.
      </p>
      <h3>Tamiya</h3>
      <p class="main__p">
        One of the most well-known vehicle scale model manufacturers. Cars, tanks, ships, motorcycles, and more. They are well-known for their accurate molding, but will require painting. I personally haven't built any yet as but I have definitely been eyeing some of the vehicle kits. They also produce alot of supplies including nippers, paint, and plastic cement.
      </p>
      <h3>Plamx/Good Smile Company</h3>
      <p class="main__p">
        Primarily a figure company, but they also produce plamo kits. Alot of their items are from an Anime IP. However, they also have some original kits as well.
