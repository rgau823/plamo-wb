        Plamo is an portmanteau of the words "plastic" and "model". They are scale models of both real and fictional things. They will also often list some sort of ratio, so yo uknow what scale it is (e.g., 1/144 or 1/100).
      </p>
      <p class="main__p">
        Be aware, plastic models come completely unassembled! I know I was quite surprised as a child to pick up a cool robot box and excited to play with the toy within, only to realize it must  be  assembled. The pieces are held on runners, which must be carefully snipped out of and assembled. It is a hobby I recommend for someone who is patient but enjoys a relaxing hobby to work with your hands a little bit.

      <p class="main__p">
        Plamo is not limited to only Gundam (commonly referred to as gunpla). There are scale models of many real life vehicles, robots from other series, humanoid figures, and even animals!
      </p>
      <p class="main__p">
        The neatest part about plastic models is the level of depth you can get into the hobby. You can just build the model out of the box and stop there, or you can customize it as much as you like. It is common to completely recolor entire model kits to your preferences or even making your own custom parts to make the kit your own!
